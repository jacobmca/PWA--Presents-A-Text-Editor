## Description
This is a single-page, PWA text editor that allows the user to write and save text. It can be used both online in a browser, or installed and used offline locally.

npm install
npm run build
npm start

Once the command line outputs that it's listening on localhost 3000, navigate to the aforementioned localhost. You should see the following:

From here, you can add and remove text of your choice.

If you click the "install" button on the top left hand corner of the screen, you can also download the program and play it locally on your device.

Functionality is identical for both the browser-based and desktop-based versions of the program. Text data is saved to IndexDB and will reappear if you exit and reenter the program.

## Credits

## Tests
In the future, I would like to give the text editor greater functionality both with regards to the content of the text. Some ideas include the ability to include links, spellcheck words, change fonts/colors. Greater utility for how text is saved and used could also factor in. Incorporating the ability to turn texts into e-mails or upload to a specified drive or cloud could also prove useful.
